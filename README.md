## Description of Class Project

The Project for the Coursera Class "Getting and Cleaning Data" was set out with five tasks. They were:
 1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
 2. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
 3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
 4. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names.
 5. From the data set in step 4, create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Cleaned and processed data was obtained from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip.

The authors provided processed datasets for measurements obtained from reading the outputs of the embedded accelerometer and gyroscope of a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) worn on the waist of 30 volunteers aged from 19 to 48 years old while performing six activities: walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, and laying [sic]. They deconvolved the total accelerometer and gyroscope readings into those due to gravity acting on the sensors and those due to the motion of the body within the gravity field. They further processed the signals to obtain signals in three orthogonal directions, x, y, and z, and computed an overall magnitude and angles between the directions of motion and the primary orthogonal coordinates. Originally measured signals were preprocessed to remove noise and sampled in fixed-width sliding windows. From each window, time- and frequency-domain features were obtained. Measurement and calculated variables were transformed into 561-feature vectors for each observation of a subject performing an activity. The data were split for training and testing of the machine learning models by randomly assigning 70% of the subjects to a training set, leaving 30% of the subject for the testing set. For each (training or testing) set, three files were supplied. Subject identifiers were supplied in the "subject_train.txt" and "subject_test.txt" files. Activity identifiers were supplied in the "y_train.txt" and "y_test.txt" files. The "X_train.txt" and "X_test.txt" files contained the processed measurement data. For the class project there was no need to consult the files with individual accelerometer or gyroscope measurements.

Other files provided in the dataset included the "README.txt," "features_info.txt" with general information about the variables used on the feature vector, "features.txt" containing a list of all features, "activity_labels.txt" that provided a table linking the activity label with the activity ID found in the "y" data tables.

Due to the preprocessing and cleaning, there were no missing or "NA" values in the datasets as read. The preprocessing also rendered the original measurement units moot, and they were not supplied.

====================================================================================

The tidy dataset for Tasks 1 through 4 of the project have been provided as text output in the same format as the original data. File "activityIDtable.txt" corresponds to the original "y" data and lists the activity IDs in the order found in the merged test and training datasets. The "activitytable.txt" file contains the correspondence table to match activity labels to their IDs. It is similar to the original "activity_labels.txt" file, but the activity lables have been modified: changed to lowercase and stripped of underscores. The "datasettable.txt" file contains the complete tidy dataset with activity lables, the subject ID, and named columns containing all (test and training) measurements corresponding to only means and standard deviations from the original "X" datasets; the size is 10299 observations (rows) of 68 variables (columns). The "subjectIDtable.txt" file contains a list of subject IDs in the order of the merged dataset, similar to the "s" files. This file is provided for completeness only, as the subject IDs were incorporated into the tidy data set. Names for all the variables, i.e., columns, including activity and subject ID, are provided in the "variablestable.txt" file.

Similar files were provided for the output from Task 5, with the suffix "-means" to distinguish the filenames. For this dataset, "activityIDtable-means.txt" contains a column for the activity ID as well as a column for the activity label. The small correspondence table for activities is in "activitytable-means.txt." The "dataset-means.txt" file contains 180 observations of 68 variables, the activity, the subject ID, and the means of the 66 variables of the dataset from Task 4 averaged over each subject for each activity. The "subjectIDtable-means.txt" file contains the subject IDs corresponding to each of the 180 observations in the dataset; again, it is provided only for completeness since the column is incorporated into the measurements data table. The "variablestable-means.txt" file contains updated names for each variable, including activity and subject ID. These variable names differ from the original in that they have had "Avg" prefixed to the original variable name to indicate that an average (mean) has been taken over a set of the original measurements.
